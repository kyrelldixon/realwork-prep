Problem 1: Unused letters
Spec
Given a string of English letters, write a function that returns all the letters of the alphabet that are
unused. For example the string "A slow yellow fox crawls under the proactive dog" would return
"bjkmqz" since none of those letters are used. The string "A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
would return "" since all of the English letters are in that sentence.
